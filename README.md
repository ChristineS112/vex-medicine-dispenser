# vex-medicine-dispenser
# Overview

This repository contains embedded software for an automatic medicine dispenser built using VEXIQ robot parts. This project aimed to solve the problem of poor medication adherance. It stored the medication in a custom container and automatically dispensed them according to an alarm set by the user. It also provided feedback based on how consistent the user was at taking their medication.

The system consists of:
- A custom-designed dispenser plate and cover to guide and release medicine
- A VEX IQ brain running embedded control software
- 3 Motors and 4 sensors to control dispensing actions

This was a team-based project, and my contributions included:

- Creating preliminary sketches of the design
- 3D modelling the dispenser plate and protective cover
- Presenting and justifying physical system design decisions to the team
- Wring functions used by main() to modularize program
- Fixing formatting issues in final report
